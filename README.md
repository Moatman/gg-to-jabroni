gg-to-jabroni
=============

Changes "gamergate" and "gamergaters" to "jabroni" and "jabronis", respectively

Inspired by Zoe Quinn, who made the same thing but hasn't released it publicly as far as I can tell.

Installation Instructions
=========================
1) Go to the Extensions page (under "More Tools")  
2) Tick the "developer mode" checkbox  
3) Drag the Source.crx file onto the page  (Note, you need either Chrome Canary or Chrome's Dev Branch for this to work on Windows)
  
Updates
=======
December 19, 2014: Need to bughunt. Chrome isn't liking this (even dev chrome).  
December 21, 2014: Fixed it. Needed to repack the crx. Gamergate -> Jabronis is now functional
