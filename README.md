gg-to-jabroni
=============

Changes "gamergate" and "gamergaters" to "jabroni" and "jabronis", respectively

Inspired by Zoe Quinn, who made the same thing but hasn't released it publicly as far as I can tell.

Installation Instructions
=========================
1) Go to the Extensions page (under "More Tools")  
2) Tick the "developer mode" checkbox  
3) Drag the Source.crx file onto the page  

Edit December 19, 2014: Need to bughunt. Chrome isn't liking this (even dev chrome).
Edit 2: Fixed it. Needed to repack the crx. Gamergate -> Jabronis is now functional
