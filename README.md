gg-to-jabroni
=============

Changes "gamergate" and "gamergaters" to "jabroni" and "jabronis", respectively

Inspired by Zoe Quinn, who made the same thing but hasn't released it publicly as far as I can tell.

Installation Instructions
=========================
1) Go to the Extensions page (under "More Tools")
2) Tick the "developer mode" checkbox
3) Drag the Source.crx file onto the page
